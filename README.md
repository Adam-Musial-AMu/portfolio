# Technical Portfolio – Adam Musiał

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio repository 👋  
This repository contains the source and documentation for my **technical portfolio**, showcasing selected projects in **Data Analysis**, **Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning**, and **Frontend Development**.

The portfolio is designed not just to present finished results, but to clearly communicate **how I think**, **how I design**, and **how I solve technical problems**.

---

## 🌍 Language versions

This portfolio is available in two language versions:

- **English (EN)** – for international recruiters, engineers, and collaborators  
- **Polish (PL)** – for local technical audiences and documentation context  

Both versions present the same projects and structure.

## 🔍 What you’ll find here

The portfolio includes projects and materials related to:

### 📊 Data Analysis & EDA
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Visualizations and insights derived from structured datasets

### 🤖 AI & Machine Learning
- Machine learning experiments and prototypes
- Applied ML solutions focused on learning, inference, and automation
- Practical, problem-driven implementations rather than theory only

### 🎨 Frontend Development
- Modern, responsive web interfaces
- Strong focus on usability, performance, and clean, maintainable code
- Frontend as a presentation layer for data and AI-driven solutions

Each project is documented with intent — explaining not only **what** was built, but also **why** and **how**.
